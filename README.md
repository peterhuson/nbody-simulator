### N-Body particle simulator implemented for CSCI1951U

Version 0.1 for initialy submission. 
- [x] Randomized number of balls created upon initialization N(10,2)
- [x] Randomized initial velocities upon initialization (v = N(2,0), Theta = U(0, 2*pi))
- [x] Randomized masses and sizes upon initialization N(4,2)
- [x] Dynamic lighting illuminates the planets
- [x] Balls cannot collide with each other
- [x] Balls collide elastically with the walls

Version 0.2 plans: 
- [ ] Balls interact with each otherâ€™s gravity implementing an N-body simulation
- [ ] Pleasing color palette
- [ ] Users specify the target framerate
- [ ] Use no more than 200 MB memory, profile code to reduce CPU usage

Version 0.3 plans: 
- [ ] The Mouse represents a body with mass when it is moved over the screen
- [ ] Scrolling increases or decreases the mass of the mouse
- [ ] Balls trace out a line or stream of dots that slowly disappears in their wake

Version 1: 
- [ ] Relativistic effects
- [ ] Add a user-configurable speed of light slider
